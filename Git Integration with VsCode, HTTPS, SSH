Integrating Git with Visual Studio Code and authenticating with GitHub may be done via SSH or HTTPS. Here are the instructions for both authentication methods:

Authentication with HTTPS:

To authenticate with GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT) over HTTPS, you'll need to generate a token in your GitHub account. Here are the steps:
GitHub Account:
If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at GitHub.
Navigate to Personal Access Tokens:
Once logged in, go to your GitHub profile, and click on "Settings."
Access Developer Settings:
In the left sidebar, under "Settings," find "Developer settings," and click on it.
Generate a New Token:
In the Developer settings menu, select "Personal access tokens," and click on "Generate token."
Configure Token:
Provide a descriptive name for the token, and choose the desired scopes based on the permissions you need. For basic Git operations, you can select the "repo" scope.
Generate Token:
Click on "Generate token" at the bottom of the page.
Copy and Save the Token:
After generating the token, GitHub will display it only once. Copy the token to your clipboard and save it securely. This token serves as your password for Git operations.
Use Token with Git:
In VSCode or any Git client, when prompted for a username and password, use your GitHub username as the username and the generated token as the password.
Authentication with SSH:
