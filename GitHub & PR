GitHub is a web-based version control tool that uses Git. It makes collaborative software development easier by offering tools for managing source code repositories, tracking changes, and facilitating seamless communication among engineers. GitHub is frequently used to host and share open-source projects, but it is also popular in private corporate settings.

Pull Requests (PRs):

Pull requests are necessary for cooperation and code review. They let contributors to suggest modifications to a repository and request that they be merged. Here is how to generate a PR:

Branch Creation:

On GitHub, navigate to the repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
Select the branches for comparison and review the changes.
Review and Merge:

GitHub's user-friendly design, collaborative capabilities, and integrations make it an effective platform for version control and project collaboration, whether for personal or large-scale open-source production.
